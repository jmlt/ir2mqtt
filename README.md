# iR2mqtt

iR2mqtt is a simple, lightweight, fast, and easy to use bridge application that connects iRacing telemetry data to MQTT, enabling integration with Home Assistant. It uses the open-source [`pyirsdk`](https://github.com/kutu/pyirsdk) library for telemetry reading and [`paho-mqtt`](https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.python) for MQTT communication.

---

## How to Use

1. Download and run the [latest release](https://github.com/jmlt/ir2mqtt/releases/latest)
2. Configure your MQTT broker settings.
   - Go to Settings - Add-ons in Home Assistant.
   - Click Add-on Store, search for Mosquitto broker, install and start it.
   - Set up credentials under Settings - Logins, and use them in iR2mqtt.

   - Set up MQTT Integration [![MQTT integration.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=mqtt)     

###### MQTT and ir2mqtt Settings example:

```
logins:
  - username: user
    password: pass
require_certificate: false
certfile: fullchain.pem
keyfile: privkey.pem
customize:
  active: false
  folder: mosquitto

```

4. Run iRacing and iR2mqtt executable to start sending iRacing telemetry to MQTT.
  Should look like this:

6. Now, we need to create the sensors:
   - Go to **HACS - Integrations**.
   - Click the three-dot menu (top right) â†’ **Custom repositories**.
   - **Repository URL:** Paste the URL of this GitHub repository <pre>https://github.com/jmlt/ir2mqtt_integration/</pre>
   - **Category:** Select `Integration`.
   - Click **Add**.
<details>
<summary>Without HACS</summary>
1. Download the latest release of the iR2mqtt integration from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/jmlt/ir2mqtt_integration/releases).
2. Extract the downloaded files and place the ir2mqtt folder in your Home Assistant custom_components directory (usually located in the config/custom_components directory).
3. Restart your Home Assistant instance to load the new integration.
</details>

7. Restart Home Assistant. 
8. Go to **Settings - Devices & Services**.  
9. Click **Add Integration** and search for **iR2mqtt**. 
   [![Add Integration](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=ir2mqtt)
10. Enter the **MQTT Topic Prefix** (if you changed the default):
   * Default value: `iracing`.
11. Click **Submit**.

12. Sensors are ready! Try this [automation example](https://github.com/jmlt/ir2mqtt/blob/main/Guides/yaml/automation-example.yaml) that changes light entity according to flags (with priorities)

or 

![QR](https://sys1823.pt/ir2mqtt/files/QR.png)

- During the PayPal donation process, **only your email address is stored** to associate the donation key with your total donated amount.
- No other personal data or payment details are stored or handled by iR2mqtt.
- Donation keys are optional and support the ongoing development of this project. (Key will be automatically generated and sent via email passed by Paypal, please check SPAM folder.)

---

## Requirements

- iR2mqtt app and integration
- MQTT broker (HA Addon and integration)
- iRacing

---

## Transparency: Lite Python Version

A **Lite version** of iR2mqtt is available in the `/python` folder. This version exists **solely** to demonstrate donation key validation and update checking logic transparently. It does **not** implement telemetry reading or MQTT publishing directly, these are handled by the external SDKs and libraries (`pyirsdk` and `paho-mqtt`).

The `main.py` in the Lite version:

- Validates donation keys entered by the user.
- Checks for program updates via GitHub releases.
- Does **not** handle telemetry or MQTT communication itself.
