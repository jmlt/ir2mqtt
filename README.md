# iR2mqtt

iR2mqtt is a lightweight bridge application that connects iRacing telemetry data to MQTT, enabling integration with Home Assistant or any MQTT-compatible platform. It uses the open-source [`pyirsdk`](https://github.com/kutu/pyirsdk) library for telemetry reading and [`paho-mqtt`](https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.python) for MQTT communication.

---

## Features

- Reads live telemetry data from iRacing.
- Publishes telemetry data to MQTT topics.
- Supports MQTT communication compatible with Home Assistant and similar platforms.
- Simple, fast, and easy to use.

## Transparency: Lite Python Version

A **Lite version** of iR2mqtt is available in the `/python` folder. This version exists **solely** to demonstrate donation key validation and update checking logic transparently. It does **not** implement telemetry reading or MQTT publishing directly, these are handled by the external SDKs and libraries (`pyirsdk` and `paho-mqtt`).

The `main.py` in the Lite version:

- Validates donation keys entered by the user.
- Checks for program updates via GitHub releases.
- Does **not** handle telemetry or MQTT communication itself.
