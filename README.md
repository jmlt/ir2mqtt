# iR2mqtt - Home Assistant
![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/jmlt/ir2mqtt)

iR2mqtt is a simple, lightweight, fast, and easy to use bridge application that connects iRacing telemetry data to MQTT, enabling integration with Home Assistant. It uses the open-source [`pyirsdk`](https://github.com/kutu/pyirsdk) library for telemetry reading and [`paho-mqtt`](https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.python) for MQTT communication.

## Usage

Once configured, all sensors will be automatically created and available in Home Assistant!

**Try this example automation:** [Flag-based lighting automation](https://github.com/jmlt/ir2mqtt/blob/main/Guides/yaml/automation-example.yaml)

This automation changes light entities according to racing flags with proper priority handling.

## Legacy Manual Configuration

If you prefer manual sensor configuration, you can still create MQTT sensors manually.

**Reference:** [sensors-example.yaml](https://github.com/jmlt/ir2mqtt/blob/main/Guides/yaml/sensors-example.yaml)

**Note:** Manual configuration is **no longer required** with the integration installed.

## Requirements

- iR2mqtt app and integration
- MQTT broker (HA Addon and integration)
- iRacing

---

## Transparency: Lite Python Version

A **Lite version** of iR2mqtt is available in the `/python` folder. This version exists **solely** to demonstrate donation key validation and update checking logic transparently. It does **not** implement telemetry reading or MQTT publishing directly, these are handled by the external SDKs and libraries (`pyirsdk` and `paho-mqtt`).

The `main.py` in the Lite version:

- Validates donation keys entered by the user.
- Checks for program updates via GitHub releases.
- Does **not** handle telemetry or MQTT communication itself.
