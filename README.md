# iR2mqtt

iR2mqtt is a lightweight bridge application that connects iRacing telemetry data to MQTT, enabling integration with Home Assistant or any MQTT-compatible platform. It uses the open-source [`pyirsdk`](https://github.com/kutu/pyirsdk) library for telemetry reading and [`paho-mqtt`](https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.python) for MQTT communication.

---

## Features

- Reads live telemetry data from iRacing.
- Publishes telemetry data to MQTT topics.
- Supports MQTT communication compatible with Home Assistant and similar platforms.
- Donation key system ("donation keys") to unlock additional telemetry features.
- Automatic update checker linking to GitHub releases.
- Simple, fast, and easy to use.

## Telemetry Data Exposed via MQTT and UI

The following telemetry fields are published and available in the UI and via MQTT:

- `session_type`
- `session_name`
- `timestamp`
- `session_time`
- `session_time_remain`
- `on_pit_road`
- `session_flags`
- `active_flags`
- `speed`
- `rpm`
- `gear`
- `fuel_level`
- `lap`

## Transparency: Lite Python Version

A **Lite version** of iR2mqtt is available in the `/python` folder. This version exists **solely** to demonstrate donation key validation and update checking logic transparently. It does **not** implement telemetry reading or MQTT publishing directly â€” these are handled by the external SDKs and libraries (`pyirsdk` and `paho-mqtt`).

The `main.py` in the Lite version:

- Validates donation keys entered by the user.
- Checks for program updates via GitHub releases.
- Does **not** handle telemetry or MQTT communication itself.

## Donation Keys and Donations

The donation keys are generated by making a donation through PayPal at the following link:

[https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=CYPAHB9LRC4TN](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=CYPAHB9LRC4TN)

- During the PayPal donation process, **only your email address is stored** to associate the donation key with your total donated amount.
- No other personal data or payment details are stored or handled by iR2mqtt.
- Donation keys are optional and support the ongoing development of this project.
